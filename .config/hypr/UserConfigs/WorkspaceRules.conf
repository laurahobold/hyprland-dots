# You can set workspace rules to achieve workspace-specific behaviors. 
# For instance, you can define a workspace where all windows are drawn without borders or gaps.

# Workspace Rules for Independent Workspaces

#


# Dynamic workspace focus behavior
# workspace_behavior = auto_focus

# Assigning workspace to a certain monitor. Below are just examples
workspace = 1, monitor:DP-1
workspace = 2, monitor:DP-1
workspace = 3, monitor:DP-1

workspace = 4, monitor:HDMI-A-1
workspace = 5, monitor:HDMI-A-1
workspace = 6, monitor:HDMI-A-1


# example rules (from wiki)
# workspace = 3, rounding:false, decorate:false
 #workspace = name:coding, rounding:false, decorate:false, gapsin:0, gapsout:0, border:false, decorate:false, monitor:DP-1
# workspace = 8,bordersize:8
# workspace = name:Hello, monitor:DP-1, default:true
# workspace = name:gaming, monitor:desc:Chimei Innolux Corporation 0x150C, default:true
# workspace = 5, on-created-empty:[float] firefox
